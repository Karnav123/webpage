                                        Here, an automation system based on MODBUS
                                        protocol has been conceptualized and implemented in the light of
                                        industrial applications. The proposed network is an improvement
                                        over existing automation techniques, as it attempts to extend
                                        the applicability of MODBUS. Thus, this work presents a
                                        methodology for empowering any sensor (irrespective of its power
                                        and function) to communicate in accordance with MODBUS
                                        protocol. Moreover, the presented system is scalable and thus
                                        can be implemented for a multiple number of sensors (slaves) to
                                        communicate with a master (any microprocessor). The absolute
                                        exploitation of open source tools in this paper supports the cost
                                        effectiveness of the idea and henceforth, encourages the usage of
                                        the same for vast and complex applications.

                                        Perturbed by the numerous instances of soldiers going untraced in action or
                                        killed in action, this paper suggests a qualitative approach to render an aid

                                        personnel. The proposed system enables to detect the pulse (heartbeat rate) and
                                        position of the army personnel whenever required, thus vouching that timely
                                        support is provided to the needy ones. The transmitter equipped with pulse
                                        sensor and GPS Module is programmed with certain conditions to examine the
                                        healthiness of the soldier and accordingly to communicate with the receiver at
                                        some remote location. This paper presents framework of the design by utilizing
                                        the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and multifarious wireless sensor networks. The
                                        initial performance of the system has been evaluated with two personal
                                        computers. Also, the real time functioning of this design encourages extending
                                        this mechanism for a wireless health monitor network for the masses.

                                        This paper reports some of the observations carried out on SUSE database for
                                        emotion classification. A comparative study is made to evaluate the performance
                                        of Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCCs) and Mel Frequency Cepstral
                                        Coefficients (MFCCs) for designing the emotion classification system for word
                                        level utterances. The significance of the orders of the coefficients has been
                                        carried out during this study. The results obtained using 12th order LPCC and
                                        13th order MFCC are compared with respect to their reduced dimensions of lower
                                        orders. A new classification system based on the feature extraction technique
                                        using the 2nd, 3rd and 4th order coefficients of both MFCCs and LPCCs is also
                                        proposed. This paper compares the accuracy level of both MFCC and LPCC,
                                        enabling us to decide which orders of the parameters (both MFCC and LPCC) are
                                        more efficient in conveying the emotion for word level utterances. The initial
                                        experiments performed at word level utterances reveal that LPCC is more
                                        efficient in detecting emotion as compared to MFCC. Further, we noticed that
                                        the emotions conveyed in word level utterances are detected more accurately
                                        than that in sentence level utterances. The result suggests that word level
                                        approach provides better performance for emotion classification as compared to
                                        sentence level approach if the system is designed using vocal tract information
                                        only.

                                        A landslide, that is, collapse of a mass of earth or rock from a mountain or
                                        cliff, is a common phenomenon in hills. Landslides pose a large threat to life
                                        and infrastructure and there is a need to develop low‐cost sensing frameworks
                                        that could help in monitoring landslides and alert people before they occur.
                                        Certain existing technologies have been used for monitoring landslides (e.g.,
                                        the use of unmanned aerial vehicle‐based remote sensing). The Internet of
                                        Things (IoT) technologies could provide alternate solutions for monitoring
                                        landslides. However, existing IoT technologies are diverse and expensive to
                                        use. Thus, there is a need for developing low‐cost IoT frameworks for
                                        monitoring landslides, especially in developing countries. This chapter
                                        proposes a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)‐based IoT framework for sensing
                                        landslides at the lab‐scale. The proposed IoT framework offers a promising
                                        low‐cost solution for monitoring landslides with a large deployment potential
                                        in landslide‐prone areas.

                                        The make-in India drive cannot succeed with software alone: a good mastery of
                                        hardware is equally important. Research and Development in both software and
                                        hardware have to go hand in hand to establish a world standard manufacturing
                                        industry. To excel in manufacturing, industrial automation is indispensable.
                                        Microcontrollers form the basis of industrial automation. </br></br>

                                        This book explains how to interface the popular open source microcontroller
                                        Arduino Uno board with a computer, running MS Windows or Linux. It explains how
                                        one can do this through open source software Arduino Integrated Development
                                        Environment (IDE). It also explains how one can effectively use the
                                        state-of-the-art open source computational engine Scilab. The use of the
                                        graphical programming environment Xcos of Scilab is illustrated. Using the code
                                        that comes with this book, one can learn to work with LEDs, LDRs, DC Motors,
                                        Push Buttons, Thermistors and Servo Motors. Easily available low-cost hardware,
                                        such as an Arduino Uno board and a Shield containing sensors and actuators have
                                        been used in all demonstrations.</br></br>

                                        This book is the result of the work done by the FOSSEE (free and open source
                                        software for education) team, IIT Bombay. FOSSEE has been promoting popular
                                        open source software through collaborative activities, such as Textbook
                                        Companions, Lab Migration and Spoken Tutorials. The Arduino experiments of this
                                        book have been validated on the affordable, but versatile, FOSSEE Laptop. The
                                        FOSSEE project is supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT,
                                        MHRD, Government of India.
